This repo contains my raw solutions for Advent of Code problems.

My personal rules are:
* Solve using python, which is my secondary language
* Solve problems as fast as possible
* Strike a good balance between readable and optimal code
* I don't hesitate to use libraries when applicable to move as fast as I can

For year 2022 and forward, I have two commits for each problem: one at the start and one at the finish. It is then possible to know when I started and how much time I spent for each problem if that can be of interest
